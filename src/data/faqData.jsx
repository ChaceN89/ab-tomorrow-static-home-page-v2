    "question": "Does the simulator show what will happen?",
    "answer": "No. When someone creates a scenario, they are running a computer simulation of things that might happen. The scenarios can never be exactly right, but they are useful to look at possible futures. The more scenarios that are run, the better we can understand how making changes today could help us with our future goals."

    "question": "How do I register for an account?",
    "answer": "Go to <a href='https://www.simulator.albertatomorrow.ca/#/registerwizard'>https://www.simulator.albertatomorrow.ca/#/registerwizard</a>. From here you can follow the prompts. Directions are also available through this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ6Pu5uByQM' target='_blank'>video</a> or this <a href='/static/pdfs/registration_instructions.pdf' target='_blank'>pdf document</a>."

  },
  {
    "question": "Will the simulator work on my computer?",
    "answer": "Check to make sure older computers support the software. Open and paste the link <a href='https://get.webgl.org/'>https://get.webgl.org/</a> into your browser - A spinning cube will appear if it works."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is my simulator running slowly??",
    "answer": "The simulator is complex; it may not work as well on older computers. Make sure you are using the most updated version of your browser. If you are using Chrome, ensure you go into your settings - advanced - and enable 'use hardware acceleration when available'. If you are a teacher and your students are going to be investigating a specific watershed, you can pre-run the simulation on your computer as the very first time a simulation is run for a specific study area it may take a few extra seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I share my work with others?",
    "answer": "You can create reports using the tool on the left hand side of the simulation. From there, you can share your report by email, Facebook, or Twitter."
  },
  {
    "question": "In past versions, as a teacher, I could see my students' reports. Can V6.0 do this?",
    "answer": "No, you don't have access to your students' reports, but they can share them with you via email through the sharing button. In the teacher dashboard, you do have access to their observations, and can delete inaccurate or duplicate observations as well as move students between teachers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need an email address to sign up?",
    "answer": "Yes, you do. Most students have school email addresses now. By tracking registered users, we are able to collect stats that help us get more funding. For more information, read the <a href='/terms-of-use'>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</a>."
