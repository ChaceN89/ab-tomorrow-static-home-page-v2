        <PolicySection title="APPLICATION">
          <PolicyText>
            The provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement”) apply to all access to or use of the Alberta Tomorrow Website and, where and as applicable, the Services (as defined below).
          </PolicyText>
          <PolicyText>
            <strong>Please read this Agreement carefully.</strong> This Agreement restricts and limits your rights. You agree to transact and contract electronically. By accepting this Agreement, and/or by accessing or using the Alberta Tomorrow website and/or the Services and/or the Materials, you enter into a binding legal agreement and contract with the Alberta Tomorrow Foundation (“Alberta Tomorrow”), and you accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as set out below.
          </PolicyText>
        </PolicySection>

        <PolicySection title="1. Governing Law and Enforcement">
          <PolicyText>
            (a) This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the province of Alberta, Canada, and the laws of Canada applicable therein. Regardless of your location of residence, domicile, or physical presence, you irrevocably attorn and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Alberta, sitting at Calgary, without regard to the conflicts of law rules or principles of such courts. You agree that you will not bring any action in any other jurisdiction, and you agree that you will not commence or maintain any action by way of class proceedings whatsoever.
          </PolicyText>
          <PolicyText>
            (b) Although the general policy of Alberta Tomorrow is to provide reasonable notice of changes to this Agreement, or the nature, quality, operation, or specifications of the Services, including any Materials (as defined below) provided or made available by Alberta Tomorrow from time to time, Alberta Tomorrow assumes no obligation to do so. You agree that Alberta Tomorrow may modify the Services, or the Materials, and/or amend this Agreement at any time without notice to you, and you agree to regularly review this Agreement for any amendments. Your continued use of the Services or Materials following such changes constitutes your acceptance of any amendments to this Agreement or modification to the Services or Materials.
          </PolicyText>
          <PolicyText>
            (c) The Services and the Materials are not available and are not to be used where prohibited or limited by law. The Services and the Materials are not available to you and must not be accessed or used by you from any location or jurisdiction, or under any circumstances, where your access to the Services or the Materials renders Alberta Tomorrow subject to the laws of any jurisdiction which may or does limit the rights of Alberta Tomorrow, or increases the liability of Alberta Tomorrow, or limits or makes void all or any part of the terms, conditions, disclaimers, and limitations of this Agreement with respect to Alberta Tomorrow.
          </PolicyText>
          <PolicyText>
            (d) In the event of any breach, or threatened or pending breach, of this Agreement by you, Alberta Tomorrow will be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without any requirement as to posting a bond, giving an undertaking as to damages, or providing proof of damages not being an adequate remedy.
          </PolicyText>

        <PolicySection title="2. The Services">
          <PolicyText>
            (a) The <strong>“Services”</strong> means access to the Alberta Tomorrow website and, to the extent permitted by Alberta Tomorrow (which requires your completing a click-through confirmation of your acceptance of this Agreement, or other mechanism confirming acceptance), your ability to use any software provided on a “software as a service” basis, including any mobile applications, and your ability to download, copy, print, and display educational and similar materials (the <strong>“Materials”</strong>).
          </PolicyText>

          <PolicyText>
            (b) The Services and the Materials are owned by and are the exclusive property of Alberta Tomorrow. The Services and the Materials are licensed, not sold.

          <PolicyText>
            (c) Alberta Tomorrow reserves the right to refuse access to the Services and the Materials to anyone for any reason at any time, and to reject or terminate the use of, or force forfeiture of any username for any reason.
